# ## Softmax Classifier
#
# Your code for this section will all be written inside **lib/classifiers/softmax.py**.
#

# In[ ]:

# First implement the naive softmax loss function with nested loops.
# Open the file lib/classifiers/softmax.py and implement the
# softmax_loss_naive function.


# Generate a random softmax weight matrix and use it to compute the loss.
W = np.random.randn(3073, 10) * 0.0001

# Why do we expect our loss to be close to -log(0.1)? Explain briefly.**

# In[ ]:

# Complete the implementation of softmax_loss_naive and implement a (naive)
# version of the gradient that uses nested loops.
